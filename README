    }
   static apiPublicKey = "APIKEYHERE"
    static apiSecretKey = "SECRETKEYHERE"
    static layoutFolder = "LAYOUTFOLDERHERE"

 When Using to Preview. Best Practices.

Call create using low res images for the preview. This will speed up the process.
Pass original image width and image height into the entries list.
When calling upload then pass original high res images.


*Edit src/home/pickthemes.js to match any theme changes you might have to setup to make a different look/feel book
*Edit src/home/picklayouts.js to match your layout jpeg images

Check up is setup as a bare bones project, you will need to decide when you want to start the book upload create process and how to deal with payment/sending to printer

Saving is setup as barebones as well. You can change how/when you would like to save books and keep track of orders locally.
